                Managing heavy workload is important not only for the desired
                outcomes but also for one's mental well being. Eventually, piled
                up tasks and assignments will lead to development of stress and
                anxiety. Imagine the disturbance it will cause to your overall
                well-being if your boss keeps calling you up for the deadlines
                you have been missing. And, here's how to de-toxic yourself.{" "}

                <strong>The 7 Essentials:</strong>

                  <strong>1. Give focus on planning</strong>
                  <p>
                    Effective planning not only saves time but gives a proper
                    framework to the task. Start your work from scratch. As in,
                    list the objective of the project, get ready the required
                    inputs and proceed. Make sure that enough time is given to
                    recheck the completed task before the deadline. So, this may
                    save you from future uncertainties. Also, try to analyse and
                    familiarize the team members with any possible obstacles
                    that may arise. And, get the solutions to those obstacles
                    beforehand.{" "}

                </p>
                <p>
                  Make sure everything is planned out. Keeping a backup plan for
                  urgency is always a good help. Also, stick to the proposed
                  framework as much as possible. Eventually, this helps in
                  managing heavy workload distribution.{" "}
                </p>
                <li>
                  <strong>2. Teamwork</strong>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Do not push yourself with over assignments. Spreading the
                    entire project among the team members is a good start. Make
                    sure everyone gets their share of the plate. Also, if you
                    find yourself not good enough with a specific task, there
                    may be other members who are well aware of it. Always
                    remember, giving the task to them not only serves your
                    purpose but also gives opportunities to them. Consequently,
                    you can now focus on areas you are equipped with.{" "}

                  <strong> Advantage of teamwork</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A well connected and inclusive team always knows the proper
                  track to follow. Also, teamwork lessens the efforts and
                  broadens the scope. And, achievements are well outlined
                  through proper teamwork. Additionally, distribution of work
                  enriches the individuals with efficiency and productivity,
                  thus managing heavy workload.{" "}

                <li>
                  <strong>3. Identify the top priorities</strong>
                  <p>
                    Priorities should always be the first. Do not lead your
                    vision to elsewhere insignificant. Remember, the timeline
                    and work should be maintained.

                <p>
                  Many experts take help of the Eisenhower Matrix. Accordingly,
                  activities can be identified as the following:{" "}
                </p>
                <ol className="px-2 space-y-2">
                  <li>1. Urgent + important</li>

                  <li>3. Urgent + not important</li>

                </ol>
                <p>
                  Always start with the first one. That is, work that is both
                  urgent as well as important. Wasting time and effort on things
                  where the results will not be welcomed will increase the
                  workload unnecessarily. This not only improves the quality but
                  also in managing heavy workload.{" "}
                </p>
                <li>
                  <strong> 4. Use your unique potential</strong>
                  <p>
                    People are gifted with different capabilities. Each one of
                    them should be acknowledged. As varying potentials and
                    desires will always be seen in a team. The best strategy is
                    to assign tasks to the individuals keeping in mind their
                    unique potentials. In the end, this will help you to master
                    the skills you desire. Consequently, shaping up your talents
                    and personalities.{" "}

                    Wasting your time and effort at things you are not good at
                    only increases the headache. Remember to get used to
                    teamwork. Also, regardless of the hierarchy of the positions
                    in a workplace, each of them should feel deserving as well
                    as appreciated. Since each one of them is contributing in
                    ways that are needed for the company's progress. In the end,
                    each piece will help in managing heavy workload.{" "}

                  <strong>5. Eliminate distractions</strong>
                  <p>
                    Physical as well as internal distractions play a significant
                    role in the backdrop of one's productivity as well as that
                    of the company. Internal distractions will have to make use
                    of various psychological solutions. Also, go with your type
                    of work space, ensure the convenience of your presence. Make
                    your room as refreshing as it can get, eventually managing
                    heavy workload.

                  Getting distracted while working is one common thing we face.
                  According to a study, distractions not only lose time but also
                  deflects your mental progression for almost 25 minutes. So if
                  you're distracted five times a day, you are wasting a total of
                  more than 2 hours a day. Remember this the next time you get
                  distracted! Managing heavy workload has a lot to do with
                  eliminating distractions.{" "}

                  <strong>6. Take breaks, don't overwork</strong>
                  <p>
                    Remember your body is not a machine. You continuously need
                    to recharge the physical as well as the mental health. This
                    will always give you the right amount of productivity and
                    efficiency, thus managing heavy workload effectively.

                <p>
                  A person can continuously work for a maximum of 50 minutes.
                  The limit should not be exceeded. After working continuously
                  for 50 minutes, take a small 10 minutes break. Additionally,
                  you may freshen up yourself during this break through a short
                  walk or a cup of coffee. Make sure you don't use up the break
                  in unhealthy stuff. Take a lunch break of 30-45 minutes in
                  between the shifts. Remember not to get yourself carried away
                  with unhealthy food. Always remember not to indulge yourself
                  in any eating disorders, this will help in managing heavy
                  workload. Overworking does not always take you far, it can
                  derail your capabilities permanently in the long run.{" "}

                  <strong>7. Stop asking too much of yourself</strong>
                  <p>
                    Do not set expectations as high as limitless. Start from
                    small steps and have patience in your progress. Never try to
                    achieve tonnes in one go. This may be successful, but can
                    cost you more than you have.{" "}

                </p>
                <p>
                  Not knowing your limits and forcefully taking yourself up the
                  space will never do good in the long run. Also, when somebody
                  reached the tip of the mountain, remember he also started from
                  the base.{" "}
                  <span className="italic">
                    Remember, take your time and it's totally okay to be late in
                    your success.{" "}
                  </span>{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do not let your confidence go down while intimidating somebody
                  else's success. Additionally, never exhaust yourself out of
                  empty promises. Remember, no one's perfect. Preserving one's
                  self esteem will help in managing heavy workload.
