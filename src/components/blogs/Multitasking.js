              <p>
                Simply, multitasking is handling multiple tasks or activities at
                a time. This may sound as appealing as much, but we need to know
                the cost it comes with. Eventually, we will discover the various
                pros and cons of multitasking. So, weigh the pros and cons of
                multitasking before giving it a shot. Here's all you need to

                  <strong> 1. Promotes time-saving</strong>
                  <p>
                    One of the top pros of multitasking is time-saving. You can
                    now produce more than one single outcome at the same amount
                    of time. That is, various tasks can be completed at a given
                    time slot. For example, check your mails or make a report
                    while on a call. The least amount of time input can generate
                    more than an output. Hence, it promotes time-saving.{" "}

                  <strong>2. Enhances productivity</strong>
                  <p>
                    Multitasking itself implies increasing the production
                    through multiple tasks handling. That is, the same amount of
                    effort and time distributed over different tasks will
                    generate higher outputs. Nowadays, companies are demanding
                    more outputs over a given time limit. Obviously, this
                    demands more control on the body and mind. However, the
                    consequences will be worth a try. Thus, multitasking
                    enhances productivity.{" "}

                <li>
                  <strong>3. Enhances efficiency </strong>
                  <p>
                    The first two points of the pros of multitasking give us a
                    clear picture. Specifically, increasing productivity while
                    saving time will always increase efficiency. That is, a
                    greater amount of output is achieved through a shorter time
                    period. Overall, multitasking enhances efficiency.

                  <strong>4. Increases flexibility</strong>
                  <p>
                    Multitasking requires a constant flexible approach while
                    handling tasks. Technically, it's nothing but jumping in
                    between the ends. That is, a multitasker will know how to
                    keep his/her perspective flexible. Too much of a concrete
                    concentration over a task may not help you while
                    multitasking. So, widen your domain in order to multitask.
                    Thus, engaging oneself in multitasking increases
                    flexibility.

                  <strong>5. Improves adaptability</strong>
                  <p>
                    The fourth pro of multitasking also signifies increasing
                    one's adaptability. That is, flexibility over various tasks
                    will enhance one's ability to adapt in different
                    circumstances. Eventually, sudden in and out of the tasks
                    will generate new adaptive approaches. Therefore,
                    multitasking also improves adaptability.

                  <strong>6. Progressive mental focus </strong>
                  <p>
                    To be able to handle various tasks at a time demands the
                    right amount of mental focus. Multitasking involves uttering
                    in and out of various tasks. Consequently, it requires the
                    ability to stay put and focussed even after certain breaks.
                    Now, this is how multitasking will groom your ability to
                    stay focused. Therefore, it helps to achieve progressive
                    mental focus.

                  <p>
                    Afterall, we all are humans. We often feel bored to get to
                    work the whole day. This is where multitasking sounds great!
                    Simply, including various other activities in a single task
                    lifts up the boredom. You can include certain activities you
                    find fun and attractive. That is, it will not only help you
                    in meeting the deadline but also enjoy it! Therefore,
                    multitasking will help you stay out of boredom.{" "}

                <li>
                  <strong>1. Decreasing quality</strong>
                  <p>
                    As multitasking associates more with the increasing
                    quantity, it often leads to reduction of quality. That is,
                    handling multiple tasks at a time leads to compromises.
                    These compromises generally associate in terms of quality.
                    Additionally, the limited time also leads to such
                    compromises. Therefore, multitasking can lead to decreasing
                    quality of the output.{" "}
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2. Building up stress </strong>
                  <p>
                    The various demands of multitasking can have certain bounds
                    in itself. Usually, the aim to complete many tasks at a
                    given time slot creates stress. Initially, the stress may be
                    little but builds up in no time. The stress to complete the
                    given tasks foregoes taking lunch or dinner. Consequently,
                    eating disorders will lead to more stress. That is, the
                    cycle can go on. Hence, multitasking usually leads to
                    building up stress.

                  <strong>3. Chronic distraction</strong>
                  <p>
                    Giving focus only on the tasks on table, often distracts you
                    from everything else. While multitasking leads to
                    progressive mental focus, it also leads to chronic
                    distraction. Studies show that chronic distraction is due to
                    unhappiness. In a nutshell, the constant desire to be able
                    to increase productivity leads to unhappiness. That is,
                    multitasking may lead to unhappiness, thus leading to
                    chronic distraction.{" "}

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>4. Procrastination</strong>
                  <p>
                    Multitasking is a disguise for procrastination. People
                    usually complain that they are doing a lot of things at a
                    time. Additionally, they also state this as the reason for
                    delay in the work. This is exactly procrastination.
                    Sometimes, people do not have the right knowledge on how to
                    do certain tasks. Apparently, they keep switching between
                    the tasks. This may look like multitasking, but it's not.
                    That is, procrastinating in the shadow of multitasking.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>5. Wastage of time due to lack of skills</strong>
                  <p>
                    The race to do many tasks at a time generally leads to
                    running around the table. Often, serious multitasking leads
                    to the work being done. Otherwise lots of time gets wasted
                    in the name of multitasking. Also, constantly switching
                    between the tasks leads to wastage of time. The lack of
                    skills to multitask hinders multitasking itself. Sometimes,
                    searching for the required inputs for the various tasks also
                    wastes time.

                  <strong>6. Frustration kills productivity</strong>
                  <p>
                    We have already talked about the generation of stress and
                    frustration by multitasking. Eventually, this causes
                    deterioration of the mental health of the individual. Also,
                    the constant desire to be able to multitask adds up another
                    hindrance. In a nutshell, the stress-the frustration-the
                    inability-the lack of skills towards multitasking
                    deteriorates mental health.
