                  Have you ever experienced any form of mental attacks? A sudden

                Here, let's deal about mental attacks. Particularly, anxiety and
                panic attacks. Usually, these two have very similar grounds of
                classification. People often consider them to be identical. But,
                they are not. In this blog, we will explain the general
                information as well as the differences between them.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                To be noted, more and more accounts of such attacks have been
                claimed till date. It's extremely important to know about them
                so that we can be prepared beforehand. Though they come suddenly
                and with no prior notice, learning about them may help while
                going through any such. Therefore, this blog is important and
                will be useful for the future as well.{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>#1 What is a panic attack?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Simply putting up, it is a sudden overwhelming fear and worry.
                Usually, panic attacks come out of the blues. These are known to
                be very unpredictable. Also, people usually mistook panic
                attacks for heart attacks. The signs and reactions could be
                quite the same. During this, your heart beats the fastest you
                ever know, your breath falls short. There could be pain in your
                chest, you might get dizzy and blacked out.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                There can be both expected as well as unexpected panic attacks
                Expected panic attacks are obvious beforehand. They have a
                particular triggering cause which is already known to the
                person. While, unexpected panic attacks are very abrupt with no
                notice or cue beforehand. These are diagnostic requirements for
                panic disorder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Panic attacks can happen only once to some people. Though they
                can be recurring to others. Usually, there are follow ups of
                panic attacks. These happen when you are in a similar situation
                that has caused you panic attacks before. Say, during traffic,
                or at the top of a tall building or facing a crowd. During this,
                the body induces fight-or-flight response. This will try it's
                best to get you out of there.{" "}

                <strong>#2 What is anxiety? </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Anxiety is a commonly faced situation. If not for excessive
                symptoms and signs, anxiety could be a normal body response. For
                example, when you are addressing a public mass or the first day
                at work. But, extreme anxiety is not normal and you sure need to
                consult a health professional. Remember, anxiety can also cause
                panic attacks.{" "}

                Anxiety is a mental health disorder characterized with worry and
                fear about what will happen. These are usually due to getting
                over anxious about something. Basically, they are due to various
                stressors. They can be life long or temporary. Also, the extent
                of it can vary over ages or situations.{" "}

                    something very unreasonable. Of course, these are intense
                    forms of fear. This can happen to anyone even with no

                    and loved ones. Literally, they worry about everything for
                    their loved ones. They fear too much that something bad will

                    This is a type of phobia where they are scared of any form
                    of embarrassment, emergency or helplessness. Usually, this
                    happens when they are inside an airplane. They fear too much

                    Sometimes, taking high dosage of powerful medications
                    induces anxiety disorder in the patients. Specifically,
                    antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs induce suicidal

                <strong>Panic attacks vs anxiety</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes, most people cannot differentiate between panic
                attacks and anxieties. Of course, they both tend to have a
                positive amount of familiarity in the consequences. But, it's
                important to know which one is which. Therefore, below listed
                are some sharp differences between the two of them.{" "}

                    Panic attacks are usually severe as compared to anxiety.
                    Anxiety can range from mild to severe. Also, anxiety can
                    occur in one's head every time of the day.{" "}

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Panic attacks are very abrupt and sometimes it happens with
                    no triggers. While, anxiety develops over time gradually.

                  <p>
                    Anxieties are known to be triggered by stressors. While,
                    panic attacks are not so. The unexpected panic attacks can
                    happen with no identified reason. The expected panic attacks
                    can have foot trails to research.

                  <p>
                    The physical symptoms of panic attacks are usually intense.
                    Since anxiety develops gradually, the symptoms do not appear
                    suddenly in just one day. Therefore, the symptoms of
                    anxieties also develop slowly and are not intense in one go.

                    Mostly, panic attacks leave long lasting fear in the
                    patient. Once a person experiences a panic attack, he/she
                    tends to live with it forever due to the fear of it.
                    Whereas, anxieties are not that instantly severe so as to
                    leave long lasting fear.

                    It is very crucial for you to have the possible lowest level
                    of alcohol or any form of drugs if you face any such
                    symptoms. Also, if you cannot stop it by yourself, take help
                    from others who can help. If you are an alcoholic, you
                    definitely need to consult a concerned professional.{" "}

                  <strong>Learn to relax in times of difficulties</strong>
                  <p>
                    As always, it's always important to be focused on the right
                    things in times of emergencies or any difficulties. This can
                    seem hard to attend, but it's absolutely possible.
                    Therefore, you need to have routine practices for training
                    your sense organs and preparing them for any such
                    situations.{" "}

                  <strong>Always take enough sleep and rest</strong>
                  <p>
                    In order to be able to fight in such times, it's important
                    that you have the right amount of weapons. That is, your
                    body's energy and resilience should be more than the normal.
                    This can be achieved through healthy living styles.
                    Importantly, good rest and a relaxing sleep for the right
                    amount of time.
