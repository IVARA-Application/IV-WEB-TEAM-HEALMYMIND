                Most of the common issues of employees at work are the stress
                that builds up. People usually take it to be normal (if you are
                working, obviously you will have some amount of stress), but
                it's not. A positive mind in a positive working environment may
                tend to develop stress but at the minimal which can be easy to
                eliminate with the least cost.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="italic border-t-2 border-gray-300 border-b-2">
                It's okay to be stressed at work as long as it's never too late
                to address and work on it. Because remember, giving up is not in
                our vocabulary.{" "}

                  <strong>Identify the cause </strong>
                  <p>
                    The first step towards solving a problem or an issue is to
                    identify the cause behind it. Find out the cause and empower
                    it through proper redressal. If the cause behind your stress
                    comes from your employer's side, make sure that the problem
                    is reached to the related authorities, identified and worked
                    upon. Here, the redressal shall come from the authority's
                    side. Otherwise, go through the other remedial measures
                    given below which are to be addressed at the individual
                    level. Always remember, you are not alone and you can always
                    take help from experts when you are not doing well.{" "}

                  <strong>Work smartly</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is an era of high advancement in technology and
                    innovation. Lots of manual work have been eased out through
                    advancement in sciences and technology. Work at an office
                    that needs computing, designing, graphics, analyzing and
                    various other creations have been greatly simplified through
                    this. Instead of putting troops' efforts manually, it always
                    makes it easier, comfortable and more presentable to be
                    working through such technologies and innovative strategies.
                    The result may turn out to be even more satisfactory than
                    doing it manually. It saves time, effort and energy. Above
                    all, it reduces stress since it's organized in a more
                    efficient manner that doesn't eat up your entire day and
                    stress you out like before.{" "}

                <li>
                  <strong>Always appreciate your work </strong>
                  <p>
                    It's said that you will never be alone when you start
                    realising your own potential. Working for hours may be
                    boring and dreadful, what's worse is not getting the
                    satisfactory feedback after the completion of the work.
                    Here, what you should always remember is that self
                    appreciation is the best form of rewarding. Your work is
                    yours and you have put in time and effort there, that gives
                    you every right to be appreciated regardless of the extent
                    of the performances. How much your boss or your colleagues
                    reward you or not for the work that you have done, at the
                    end of the day, it's always self satisfaction that will last
                    the longest. No matter what, the best will come from the
                    depth of yourself. Knowing your worth and rewarding your
                    worth, is the best combo. Keep rewarding yourself!

                  <strong>Give yourself 'quality personal time' </strong>
                  <p>
                    You have worked for hours at the office? Now is the time to
                    end the day with some quality 'me time'. How much productive
                    you have been the entire day, now is the time to give
                    yourself back the debt for being such productive! Always
                    remember that both your mind and body need to be recharge on
                    a daily basis for the best outcome. Music, meditation, a
                    candlelit dinner, a dance session, a karaoke, games, a
                    beautiful book, a good night sleep will always do good to
                    your health. Make time to engage yourself in the passion you
                    have always graced upon. Family and loved ones who have
                    always been ignored throughout the journey of your work,
                    could do a little gathering by the end of the week/day.
                    Making memories and fun with a nuance of happiness is always
                    one of the best!{" "}

                  <strong>Physical fitness</strong>
                  <p>
                    Workout and exercises do a great help towards mental health.
                    They help to reduce the level of the body's stress hormones.
                    They can range from a simple activity you enjoy repeating,
                    such as an evening walk, jogging, yoga, exercises, singing,
                    meditating etc to extreme workouts. Physical wellness and
                    maintenance of it fortify high self-confidence and
                    self-esteem to oneself, thus leading towards success. Do not
                    leave behind your own health while being fully occupied with
                    work. To be able to balance work, life and health at the
                    same time is said to be a skill most of us lack. Health is
                    wealth, nothing is possible when you are left bedridden in
                    the hospital chambers. So, make hay while the sun shines but
                    keep track of your own health. That way, you can shine.{" "}

                  <strong>Overcome insecurities</strong>
                  <p>
                    Having a constant fear of other's judgement, feedback and
                    reactions is a form of insecurity that underestimates one's
                    own potential. Knowing your limit is good but not trying
                    beyond your limit is not fine either. Usually the employees
                    in a workplace tend to overthink about what the boss will
                    say, which may lead to decreased performances due to over
                    -fear and lack of confidence. Boosting yourself with
                    confidence and commitments, shaping your personality in a
                    way that answers people's judgement can help to overcome
                    insecurities in life as a whole. It is easier said than
                    done, but try to say YES to new domains that you fear you
                    might not be compatible with. Experiences are known to drive
                    one's growth in a field. Try to take control of your
                    insecurities and make them secure!{" "}

                  <strong>Get help from trusted sources</strong>
                  <p>
                    We are never alone. If you find it difficult to handle the
                    hardships you have been facing, always remember to reach
                    out. When you think of quitting your job due to the stress
                    that piled up, remind yourself of the achievements you have
                    made in the past and carry forward by reaching out to
                    someone you trust. Trusted sources can be your family
                    members, friends, colleagues or a therapist if the situation
                    is heavy. Take psychological help through various
                    online/offline programmes through yourself/a consulted
                    therapist. There is nothing to be embarrassed about reaching
                    out to others and it doesn't make you weak or vulnerable in
                    any way. It actually makes you stronger than before to be
                    able to speak out, reach out. Be strong and take the
                    necessary help.
