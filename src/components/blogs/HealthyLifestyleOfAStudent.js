                    What is the lifestyle of a student?
                  </strong>
                  <p>
                    Student life is full of new and exciting experiences and
                    there is often lots going on. It is important to take the
                    time to look after yourself to help you cope with the
                    changes in lifestyle. Some areas that you could focus on
                    are: Managing stress.In today’s scenarios a student
                    lifestyle is more hectic when it comes to managing the
                    living of a teenager where a normal adult(student) having so
                    much pressure where they couldn’t even focusing on their
                    health and been so much pressurized is difficult to maintain
                    a healthy lifestyles, in current era where an adult
                    (student) is busy with managing their work load where it
                    could be anything like studies,relations with friends and
                    families, focusing on Or building their near future, etc the
                    good and healthy body physically and mentally need to be
                    stronger, to maintain a beautiful Or it be healthy lifestyle
                    keeping a healthy diet is the most important thing eating
                    healthy food and avoiding the unnecessary intakes makes a
                    huge difference in maintaining a good Or healthy lifestyle,
                    diet, physic of a student where if they maintain such a
                    wonderful lifestyle would bring a tremendous change in their
                    living, so the simple mantra is to eat good and the intake
                    of nutrition would be way better to bring a healthy
                    lifestyle. A teen should add more fruits and vegetables in
                    your diet and eat less carbohydrates, high sodium and
                    unhealthy fat. Avoid eating junk food and sweets. Avoid
                    skipping a meal—this will only make your body crave more
                    food the moment you resume eating.

                    Are you also one of them who seeks paradise on earth? Well,
                    it might be hard to picture a specific place as such. But,
                    happiness is the road as well as the method to it. Happiness
                    can do wonders!

                    <li>
                      Balance your meals. Have protein, healthy carbohydrate,
                      fat and vegetables and/fruit at each meal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Healthy Carbohydrates include brown rice, whole wheat
                      breads, pastas and crackers, starchy vegetables like sweet
                      potatoes, parsnips and potatoes, quinoa, millet, amaranth.

                    <li>
                      Eat three meals plus snacks. Eating three meals plus
                      snacks ensures that you will eat on a schedule and get
                      enough calories and nutrients. The metabolism functions
                      best on a similar schedule daily. Eating every 4-5 hours
                      guarantees plenty of energy and an efficient metabolism.

                    <li>
                      Snacks are important if you get hungry in between meals.
                      They consist of a protein and/or fat + a carbohydrate
                      (refer to snacking handout). Snacks keep your energy going
                      until meal time and reduce your chances of over eating at
                      meals.

                    <li>
                      Proportion your plate to visually have about ½ vegetables
                      and/or fruit, ¼ protein, ¼ healthy carbohydrate and some
                      fat at each meal.

                    Body Maintenance: Be nice to your body and pay attention to
                    what it needs

                      Eat enough every day — not eating enough tells your body
                      to conserve calories and energy, and so the next time you
                      eat more of the energy will be retained rather than being
                      properly used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Hydrate – Dehydration makes you feel tired. Caffeine and
                      alcohol are very dehydrating. Balance caffeine or alcohol
                      consumption with non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic fluids.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Sleep – Sleep deprivation increases appetite (and often
                      body weight) and decreases brain function. So proper sleep
                      helps your energy, weight maintenance and your ability to
                      think and concentrate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exercise – Try to exercise at least 30 minutes a day,
                      three times a week – it can even be split up into 10
                      minute walks. The effects of brief physical exertion last
                      much longer than those of caffeine, and exercise decreases
                      stress rather than increasing it! Finding a physical
                      activity that you really like to do will make exercise
                      more fun and something to look forward to as well as help
                      to keep you healthy throughout life. So try something new
                      or something that has always appealed to you.

                    In a busy life of a student it’s nearly not possible to take
                    a good time for themselves or to work on themselves where an
                    individual improves his/her weakness and try to work on
                    them. In a hectic lifestyle of a adult (student) the mental
                    health is the key where an individual has it’s own state of
                    mind. Where he/she is a manager of his/her living. Every
                    student should practice yoga, write a journal, meditate, see
                    a therapist, or have another way of dedicating time to your
                    mental health, it is just as important to make time for this
                    type of exercise as it is to make time to go to the gym.
                    Having a healthy mental state will help you stay on track
                    with your fitness goals and will allow you to balance your
                    busy and crazy life with ease. Find the method that works
                    best for you and stick to it!

                    Every student is busy now days working on their or building
                    a good future for them where they just not following a good
                    eating habits which may not leads to a healthy living. In a
                    student life they are busy in studying, gaining knowledge
                    going to schools, coaching centers or other place so it’s
                    really tough to stick to the diet . I rarely say NEVER or
                    ALWAYS, but this is an exception to that rule. Never assume
                    that there will be a healthy option when you eat away from
                    home. Always be prepared. Check out the restaurant menu
                    ahead of time, pack healthy snacks, bring a lunch, bring a
                    healthy dish to share, or eat something small before so you
                    aren’t starving. You are in control of your health. It’s not
                    anyone elses responsibility to make sure there is something
                    nutritious for you to nosh on.

                    You might feel like there is a lot of pressure to do well
                    academically, as well as pressure to be sociable. In
                    particular, mature students often say that they feel
                    particularly under stress if they are struggling financially
                    and they have invested money in the course as part of a
                    career change, which can create extra pressure to do well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try to build up strategies to manage stress before it gets
                    too much, so it’s easier to respond to additional pressure –
                    for example, around exam times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try out some mindfulness exercises. There is a lot of
                    evidence to suggest these can be really helpful, especially
                    for managing stress. Take a look at our mindfulness pages
                    for more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try using a planner. This can help to keep track of
                    deadlines and key commitments and organise your study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Take time out to relax. Getting away from your desk, even
                    for short periods of time, can help keep you calm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keep an eye on social commitments to avoid overloading your
                    schedule around deadlines and exams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try online support and apps. There are lots of apps and
                    websites available that can help you to manage your stress
                    levels, such as those offering a daily meditation or
                    mindfulness practice. For more information on online
                    support, including apps, have a look at our pages on mental
